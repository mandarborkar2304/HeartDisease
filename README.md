# HeartDisease
**Project Title: Heart Disease Analysis using Machine Learning Algorithms**

**Project Overview:**

Cardiovascular diseases remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. This project aims to develop a predictive model for heart disease analysis using machine learning algorithms. The analysis will focus on various factors such as age, gender, maximum heart rate, and chest pain type to provide valuable insights into potential risk factors.

**Objectives:**

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Acquire a comprehensive dataset containing relevant features, including age, gender, maximum heart rate, and chest pain type.
   - Perform data preprocessing, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
   - Visualize the data to gain insights into potential patterns and correlations.

3. **Feature Selection:**
   - Identify key features that significantly contribute to heart disease prediction.
   - Evaluate the importance of age, gender, maximum heart rate, and chest pain type in predicting heart disease.

4. **Model Selection:**
   - Utilize three different machine learning algorithms for heart disease prediction: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest Classifier.
   - Implement a train-test split to ensure the models' performance is evaluated on unseen data.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Fine-tune the models using hyperparameter optimization techniques such as RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV to enhance their predictive accuracy.

6. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the performance of each model using key metrics, including confusion matrix, classification report, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Visualize the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves to assess the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.

7. **Cross-Validation:**
   - Implement cross-validation using cross_val_score to ensure the robustness of the models and prevent overfitting.

8. **Results Interpretation:**
   - Interpret the results to identify the most effective model and understand the impact of different features on heart disease prediction.

**Tools and Libraries:**
- Python
- Scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, train_test_split, cross_val_score, RandomizedSearchCV, GridSearchCV, confusion_matrix, classification_report, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, RocCurveDisplay)
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

**Expected Deliverables:**
- A well-documented and commented Python codebase.
- Visualizations and insights derived from exploratory data analysis.
- Evaluation metrics and comparisons of the three machine learning models.
- Recommendations for identifying high-risk individuals based on the analysis.

**Conclusion:**
By leveraging machine learning algorithms and comprehensive data analysis, this project aims to provide a valuable tool for identifying potential risk factors and predicting heart disease based on age, gender, maximum heart rate, and chest pain type. The insights gained from this analysis can contribute to preventive healthcare strategies and personalized patient care.
